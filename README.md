# Knee-Osteoarthritis-Structural-Prognosis-Tool

KOSP (Knee Osteoarthritis Structural Prognosis Tool) is a clinically oriented software application designed to predict the risk of rapid structural progression of knee osteoarthritis. Based on imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and radiography) data for the outcomes KOSP evaluates three biomarkers and two osteoarthritis risk factors. By analyzing these parameters, KOSP assists healthcare professionals in identifying patients at elevated risk of joint deterioration, facilitating earlier interventions and personalized treatment planning. Seamlessly integrating into clinical workflows, KOSP offers evidence-based support for specialists aiming to monitor and manage knee osteoarthritis with precision.

4) It will now give the option to run anyway
5) The app may need to download the Runtime function from MATLAB, but this does not require a MATLAB installation or license.

Usage: To use the application, you may open up it by searching for KOSP in the windows search bar, or to use the desktop shortcut. Once more, this function, like any other regular application, is similar to opening a calculator application on your computer. Once opened, you may input the patient data, and click "Predict" to obtain the prognosis

MATLAB R2024a was used for this project.
