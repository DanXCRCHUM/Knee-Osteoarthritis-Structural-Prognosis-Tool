# Knee-Osteoarthritis-Structural-Prognosis-Tool

KOSP (Knee Osteoarthritis Structural Prognosis Tool) is a clinically oriented software application designed to predict the risk of rapid structural progression of knee osteoarthritis. Based on imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and radiography) data for the outcomes KOSP evaluates three biomarkers and two osteoarthritis risk factors. By analyzing these parameters, KOSP assists healthcare professionals in identifying patients at elevated risk of joint deterioration, facilitating earlier interventions and personalized treatment planning. Seamlessly integrating into clinical workflows, KOSP offers evidence-based support for specialists aiming to monitor and manage knee osteoarthritis with precision.
