# Knee-Osteoarthritis-Structural-Prognosis-Tool

KOSP (Knee Osteoarthritis Structural Prognosis Tool) is a clinically oriented software application designed to predict the risk of rapid structural progression of knee osteoarthritis. Based on imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and radiography) data for the outcomes KOSP evaluates three biomarkers and two osteoarthritis risk factors. By analyzing these parameters, KOSP assists healthcare professionals in identifying patients at elevated risk of joint deterioration, facilitating earlier interventions and personalized treatment planning. Seamlessly integrating into clinical workflows, KOSP offers evidence-based support for specialists aiming to monitor and manage knee osteoarthritis with precision.

Installation: 
1) Click on the MyAppInstaller_web.exe provided within this repository (if taken to a new page please click on "View raw" to begin the download, else just download from the repository).
2) Double click on the MyAppInstaller_web.exe to run the installer.
3) a Page will show up explaining your PC may be at risk (there are no risks its just the windows defender doing its job) CLICK  ON "More info".
4) It will now give the option to run anyway, please run the installer.
5) The installer will ask for the destination of the files and wheather you'd like a desktop shortcut, then will ask to download MATLAB Runtime, then will ask for a confirmation. Click "Next" for these steps and "Begin install". This download will only need to happen once.

Usage: To use the application, you may open up it by searching for KOSP in the windows search bar, or to use the desktop shortcut. Once more, this function, like any other regular application, is similar to opening a calculator application on your computer. Once opened, you may input the patient data, and click "Predict" to obtain the prognosis.

MATLAB R2024a was used for this project.
