# Knee-Osteoarthritis-Structural-Prognosis-Tool (KOSP)

KOSP is a clinically oriented software application designed to predict the risk of rapid structural progression in knee osteoarthritis. Based on imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and radiography) data for the outcomes, KOSP evaluates three biomarkers and two osteoarthritis risk factors to generate prognostic insights. By analyzing these parameters, KOSP assists healthcare professionals in identifying patients at an elevated risk of joint deterioration, facilitating earlier interventions and personalized treatment planning. Seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows, KOSP offers evidence-based support for specialists aiming to monitor and manage knee osteoarthritis with precision.


Installation Instructions

1.	Download the installer. Locate and click on the MyAppInstaller_web.exe in this repository. If redirected to a new page, please click "View raw" to begin the download.

2.	Run the installer. Double-click on the downloaded file to launch the installation process.

•	It will now give the option to run anyway. Please run the installer.

•	The installer will ask for:

	- the destination of the files;
  	- whether you'd like a desktop shortcut; 
 	- to download MATLAB Runtime (required only once), then it will ask for a confirmation; 
	- click "Next" for these steps and "Begin install". This download will only need to happen once.

    
Usage 

To launch the application.

•	To use the application, you may open it by searching for KOSP in the Windows search bar or by using the desktop shortcut. 
•	Once opened, input the patient data and click "Predict" to generate the prognosis. This interface functions similarly to standard desktop applications, such as a calculator.
This project was developed using MATLAB R2024a.
The application has been archived on Zenodo to ensure long-term accessibility and reproducibility. A DOI (10.5281/zenodo.xxxxxxx) has been assigned for citation purposes.
